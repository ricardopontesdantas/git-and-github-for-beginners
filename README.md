# Git For Beginners

This is a repository for learning and remembering some Git commands (for me and everyone)

## Commands

### git init

When you want to create a new repository for your project, use `git init` in your project folder (empty or not). For example, you have a project folder called 'my-project'. So you should access this folder and create your repository with the git command below.

```
git init
```

### git diff

When you want to see the difference between after and before saving a file, use `git diff <filename>`. See the example below:

```
git diff main.js
```
